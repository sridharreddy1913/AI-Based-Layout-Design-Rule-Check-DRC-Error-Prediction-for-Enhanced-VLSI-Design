# AI-Based-Layout-Design-Rule-Check-DRC-Error-Prediction-for-Enhanced-VLSI-Design
This research work introduces the use of artificial intelligence techniques in the predicting of
Design Rule Check (DRC) mistakes incurred during VLSI layout designing processes. DRC
is important in ensuring that the Integrated Circuits will work and they can be manufactured,
but the cost of correcting errors generated by traditional methods is high, complicated and
takes time. This research work reduces the design process cycle time by the application of
the machine learning techniques in the estimating of the DRC errors at an early stage of the
design process. Errors in DRC rules were predictably better than conventional methods
where the model was tested.
